# Rock-paper-scissors-GUI
Hey, my name is Josh. One of my favourite things I made when I was learning Python was a console rock, paper, scissors program, so I decided to make a graphical one! I quite like how it came out, but it's missing a point tally, so if you think of a smart way to incoperate it, then go ahead.

Features:

  Slick UI
  
  Dark/Light Mode
  
  Adjustable screen size
  
  Fully functional rock, paper, scissors game!
  
Requirements:

  Pygame library and Python installed
  
  All files in one folder
  
  If you change your resolution, then just reopen the game to apply the effects
  
  Also if you make your resolution to big than just delete the values in the conf.txt file
